## Links to open-sourced projects

- https://github.com/alexeyrazuvaev/the-beam - project, which aim was to 'be better than static html site'. We just wanted our contenters to be able to edit some areas without any prorgrammers help. 
- https://github.com/alexeyrazuvaev/slave_45 - the worst code I've ever written. 3 hours to congratulate one of my colleguaes. No tests, no complex logic. Just a single static page and scaffold-based form.
